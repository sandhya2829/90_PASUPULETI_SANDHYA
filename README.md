AI Customer Service Agent  
(RAG over Customer Support Tickets & Dialogues)

---

## Problem Statement

Customer support teams receive **hundreds of repetitive queries every day** such as:
- Order status
- Refund requests
- Account issues
- Delivery delays

Human agents must read old tickets and chat histories repeatedly to answer similar questions.  
This causes:
- Slow response times
- Inconsistent answers
- High operational cost

---

## Proposed Solution

We built an **AI Customer Service Agent** that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer customer queries **accurately and instantly** by learning from **past tickets and chat dialogues**.

Instead of guessing, the AI:
- Searches relevant past tickets
- Uses only verified information
- Generates clear, human-like responses

---

## How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. Customer asks a question  
2. System retrieves similar past tickets & conversations  
3. Relevant information is passed to the AI model  
4. AI generates a grounded, accurate response  
5. Final answer is shown to the user
